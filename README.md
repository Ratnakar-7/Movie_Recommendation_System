#Movie Recommendation System
This is a simple movie recommendation system that takes a movie name as input and recommends 5 similar movies based on the plot summaries of movies. The system uses natural language processing techniques to analyze the plot summaries of movies and find movies with similar plot summaries.

#Data
The movie recommendation system uses a dataset of over 5,000 movies obtained from the MovieLens dataset. The dataset contains information on the title, genres, and plot summaries of the movies. The system preprocesses the plot summaries using natural language processing techniques, such as tokenization and stemming, to extract meaningful features from the text.

#Algorithm
The movie recommendation system uses a cosine similarity algorithm to calculate the similarity between the input movie and other movies in the dataset. The cosine similarity algorithm measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which in this case represent the plot summaries of movies. Movies with higher cosine similarity scores are considered more similar to the input movie.

#Conclusion
The movie recommendation system is a simple yet effective way to discover new movies that are similar to movies you already enjoy. By leveraging natural language processing and cosine similarity algorithms, the system is able to provide accurate and relevant movie recommendations based on the plot summaries of movies.
